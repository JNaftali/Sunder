cecho("\n<ForestGreen>Hunting after those elusive minors and lessers has never been easier! This will walk you through how to do that with a few easy steps. To start, you will need to make sure you have learned <DeepSkyBlue>LEYLINES <ForestGreen>in <MediumTurquoise>Vision <ForestGreen>(289 lessons) and <DeepSkyBlue>SHACKLING <ForestGreen>in <MediumTurquoise>Refining <ForestGreen>(239 lessons). While <DeepSkyBlue>shackling <ForestGreen>is not necessarily needed for this to work, it will benefit you in the long run and keep you from having to deal with multiple eld at once. In the process of learning <DeepSkyBlue>leylines<ForestGreen>, you will also learn <DeepSkyBlue>DETECTION<ForestGreen>, which will assist you in finding focal points. This is only needed if you do not have any reserves to use <MediumTurquoise>MANIPULATE PYLON FOR NODESENSE<ForestGreen>, which allows you to PATH TRACK MINOR directly to the focal point. For this, you will also need to purchase ylem goggles from the vendor at your pylon. Just PATH TRACK PYLON and ASK <vendor> WARES to BUY GOGGLES FROM <vendor>.")

cecho("\n<CadetBlue>HOW IT WORKS!")
cecho("\n<MediumSeaGreen>-------------")
cecho("\n<ForestGreen>The <green>Sunder <ForestGreen>ylem finder is simple to use! To start, just type in <DeepSkyBlue>goylem start <ForestGreen>and watch as it does all the work of walking around for you. It has a set path that it follows and is easy to change if you wish to do so or if new areas are added before <green>Sunder <ForestGreen>is updated again. It will continually run until it finds either a minor or a lesser. If it finds a minor, you can either DETECTION ON and walk around to find the focal point (it is highlighted in <green>Sunder<ForestGreen> already, so you won't miss it!) or you can PATH TRACK MINOR if you have ylem goggles and have used MANIPULATE PYLON FOR NODESENSE. The nodesense defense will only last for one hour or ten uses. Once you find the minor and extract it (EXTRACTION is the syntax) fully, you can <DeepSkyBlue>goylem next <ForestGreen>to have <green>Sunder <ForestGreen>continue the set path. If you need to stop at any point, you can <DeepSkyBlue>goylem stop <ForestGreen>and it will take you back to your city and reset the variables to start over if you decide to pick it up again. If you need to stop temporarily, you can just <DeepSkyBlue>stap<ForestGreen> and then <DeepSkyBlue>goylem <ForestGreen>to start back up again where you left off!")
