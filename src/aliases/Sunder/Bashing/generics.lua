cecho("\n<red>The use of a generic word (ie 'kelki' instead of 'kelki1234' or just '1234') brings with it a certain amount of risk. You risk hitting an NPC that you may not mean to, including quest mobs with the same short name, or boss mobs in the same vein. This is your warning. Please use it when appropriate.")
